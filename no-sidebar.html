												<h2>Tier 3</h2>
												<p>Clothing in this tier represents a more basic level of sustainability</p>
											</header>

											<span class="image featured"><img src="images/pic10.jpg" alt="" /></span>

											<p>Impact: Negligibly reduces environmental harm, and in some cases, could even contribute to environmental degradation. Choosing products from this tier is a missed opportunity to support more sustainable alternatives.</p>

											<h3>More intriguing information</h3>
											<p>Tier 3 (Red) clothing represents a more basic level of sustainability, with a higher environmental impact throughout its lifecycle. These garments typically last between 20-30 washes before showing noticeable wear, such as fading or fabric degradation. The manufacturing process in this tier often relies on conventional energy sources, which contribute to carbon emissions, and uses water-intensive production methods, putting additional strain on water resources. The materials used are primarily conventional, such as polyester, nylon, or non-organic cotton, which have a higher environmental footprint due to the use of synthetic fibers and chemical-intensive agricultural practices. These materials also shed microplastics during washing, contributing to ocean pollution. Additionally, labor practices in Tier 3 production may not always meet ethical standards, affecting worker conditions and pay.</p>

											<p>Packaging for Tier 3 products is often made from plastic or other non-recyclable materials, adding to the global waste problem. At the end of their life, these garments are typically not recyclable or biodegradable, meaning they are more likely to end up in landfills, where they take years to break down, leaching harmful chemicals into the environment. While Tier 3 clothing may be more affordable and accessible, its environmental cost is significant. It is suitable for consumers just starting to make more sustainable choices, but it remains a less eco-friendly option when compared to higher-tier alternatives, which offer better durability, ethical production practices, and minimal environmental impact.
