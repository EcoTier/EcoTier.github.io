														<h2>Tier 2</h2>
														<p>clothing in this tier provides a balance between sustainability and practicality
														</p>

													<p>Impact: Moderately reduces your environmental footprint. While still a better option than non-sustainable choices, more improvements are needed to make these products truly eco-friendly.
													</p>

													<h3>More intriguing information</h3>
													<p>Clothing in this tier provides a balance between sustainability and practicality. While not as long- lasting as Tier 1, these garments maintain good durability, lasting through 30-50 washes with some signs of wear, such as fading or thinning fabric. The manufacturing process integrates some sustainable practices, such as energy- efficient machinery and reduced water usage, though not to the same extent as Tier 1. Materials used are a mix of organic or recycled and conventional fabrics, offering a moderate environmental footprint.
													</p>

													<p>Packaging in Tier 2 is mostly recyclable, though some non-recyclable elements may still be present. At the end of its life, the clothing may be partially recyclable or upcycled, though it could still contribute to landfill waste. Tier 2 represents a middle ground, offering a reasonably sustainable option for consumers looking for better quality without fully committing to the highest eco-standards.
