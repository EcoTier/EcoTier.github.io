												<h2>What is Eco Tier?</h2>
												<p>At Eco Tier, our mission is to revolutionize the way people shop by empowering them to make more sustainable choices. We believe that small, conscious decisions can lead to big changes, especially when it comes to reducing our collective carbon footprint. That’s why we’ve developed a simple yet powerful system: our Eco Tier icons.

													These icons, displayed on clothing tags, provide clear and easy-to-understand information about the environmental impact of each item. From materials used to production methods and end-of-life recyclability, our icons help shoppers quickly assess how eco-friendly their purchases are. By making sustainability transparent and accessible, we aim to drive a shift towards more responsible consumer behavior.
													
													At Eco Tier, we’re not just measuring impact; we’re inspiring change. Together, we can pave the way toward a more sustainable future, one purchase at a time.  <strong>pretty awesome</strong> ...</p>

													<h2>Why do we do it?</h2>
													<p>We do it because the planet can’t wait!</p>
												</header>
												<p>The fashion industry is a major contributor to global carbon emissions, water pollution, and waste. Yet, many people remain unaware of the true environmental cost of their purchases. At Eco Tier, we believe knowledge is power. By providing consumers with the tools to make informed decisions, we can spark a collective movement toward sustainability. Our goal is to make sustainability simple, actionable, and impactful. Through our Eco Tier icons, shoppers can easily see the environmental impact of their choices, empowering them to opt for more eco-friendly options that align with their values and lifestyles. This isn’t just about reducing emissions—it’s about fostering a mindset of responsibility, care, and conscious consumption that extends across all industries. Every small decision counts, and together, we can create a future where sustainable shopping becomes second nature. By changing how we shop, we can help the planet, drive real change, and make a meaningful difference for generations to come for our planet and people.

													How Will Our Tier System Help the Planet?
													Empowering Choices, Driving Change.
													
													Our tier system will help the planet by transforming the way we shop and reducing the environmental impact of the fashion industry. Each Eco Tier icon highlights key sustainability metrics—such as carbon footprint, water usage, and recyclability—empowering consumers to choose products that align with eco-friendly practices.
													
													By encouraging brands to adopt more sustainable materials and processes, our system creates a ripple effect: the more consumers prioritize eco-conscious products, the more businesses will shift toward greener practices. This means fewer emissions, less waste in landfills, and a more sustainable use of our planet’s resources.
													
													Ultimately, our tier system fosters accountability and drives collective action, proving that small, informed choices can lead to significant environmental change. Together, we can reduce waste, conserve resources, and move closer to achieving net zero.</p>
